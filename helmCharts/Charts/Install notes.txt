prerequesits:
1. google cloud tools
2. chocolatey (to install kompose and helm)
3. kompose - though the charts are now built, but to re-create them from docker-compose.yaml.
4. helm

# start the gcloud session:
gcloud auth login

# install the project:

# first you need to install the configmap to configure mongo user. for some reason helm doesn't like this file.
# you can find it in the same directory as this
kubectl apply -f configmap-mongoinit.yaml

# second, using helm for all the rest, from the local directory with mbgenerator (containing charts) folder in it.
helm install mbgenerator --generate-name

# to uninstall:
helm uninstall mbgenerator-{whatever ID it was given}

###some useful kubectl commands:
# create a k8s manifest/chart for an existing element (configmap mongoinit in this case) and pipe output to a file
kubectl get configmap mongoinit -o yaml > configmap-mongoinit.yaml


# in order to set the number of partitions on the imageReq topic (seems the environment variable is ignored)

# open a shell onto the kafka broker:
kubectl exec -it {kafka-server1-xxxx} -- /bin/bash

# run the following command:
cd /opt/bin/kafka
./kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper zookeeper-server:2181 --topic imageReq --alter --partitions 10
